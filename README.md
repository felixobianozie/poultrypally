PoultryPally is a digital assistant with a complete set of tools for small & medium scale poultry farm management.   

It is a free digital product for the everyday farmer. The ‚ú®magic‚ú® in this app is just incredible!  

It is strictly designed with simplicity in mind to help the next door farmer keep track of everything about his bird livestock.  

This product has the simplest learning curve and is your best choice.  

PoultryPally is constantly improving with more features being added on a regular basis.  



## The Inspiration üå§Ô∏è
In my demographic, there are more poultry farmers than there are of any other livestock. On the fateful day, my nextdoor neigbour who has a bird farm expressed some frustration over not getting the right tool to manage her farm. "...they either are just too complex and overpriced or too simple to fit my needs as a small/medium scale everyday farmer." Those were her exact words when I inquired about the already existing tools. I thought, "a Software Engineer is a problem solver right?" That thought led to something, which led to another, and here we are with this spectacular product...</smiles>.

**NB:** *PoultryPally is a miniature version of [**FarmPally**]() a larger, premium, full featured farm management tool by thesame author*



## Features üòÆ

- Many more great features on the way...

This product is available for free public use at the following link: [PoultryPally App Link]()   
**NB**: *In the event of a downtime or inaccessibility, please try again later.*



## Run Locally üèÉ
Want to install and run the app locally on your machine? Let's do it then!

 **1.   Clone the project**
 ```
git clone https://github.com/felixobianozie/poultrypally
```  

 **2.   Confirm that Python 3+ is installed on your machine.**
  ```
  python --version
  ```  

 **NB:** 
 If Python is installed, you should see a message like ‚ÄúPython 3.x.x‚Äù. Note that ‚Äú3.x.x‚Äù represents the version number of Python. Proceed to the next section (3).
 
 If Python 3+ is not installed, install it using the following [GUIDE](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/install-python). After installation, join me at the next section (3).

 **3.   Setup a virtual environment**   
  **NB:** *On mac or ubuntu, change all "python" to "python3" and "pip" to "pip3" and you will be fine.*

 **Install virtualenv** *(a tool for creating python virtual env with ease)*
  ```
  sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv
  ```
  **Create virtual environment**
  ```
  virtualenv venv
  ``` 
 
  Where "venv" is my preferred name for the virtual environment. You may change it to whatever fits for you.  
  
  **NB:** There are other ways of creating virtual environments in Python, checkout this [GUIDE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-virtual-environment-using-venv-python/)

  **Activate the virtual environment**   
  Windows:
  ```
  venv\scripts\activate
  ```
  Mac:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
  Where "venv" remains the name of your virtual machine as specified during the creation stage.
  
  If your got here successfully, then we are in for the sweeter stuff, getting the app to run!ü•Ç
  
   **4. Install All App Dependencies**
  ```
  sudo -H pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  **5. Setup Project Dependent Variables**
  - Copy **"_migrations"** folder from **"/local"** to **"/base"**
  - Rename **"_migrations"** folder in **"/base"** to **"migrations"** i.e removing the preceeding underscore
  - Copy **"_.env"** file from **"/local"** to **"/poultry"** *(thesame folder that holds settings.py)*
  - Rename **"_.env"** file in **"/poultry"** to **".env"** i.e removing the preceeding underscore

  **NB:** At this point you may delete "/locals" if you wish. Leaving it causes no harm either.

  **6. Perform Django Data Migration**
   ```
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
  **NB:** This step performs all the needed connection and database setups between the application models, Django ORM and the database.
  The open source version of this project is configured to SQL Lite by default, but runs MySQL in production. To switch to a different database, refer to this [GUIDE]()

   **7. Start The App Server**
   ```
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
  **NB:** This runs the app on localhost:8080 by default.
